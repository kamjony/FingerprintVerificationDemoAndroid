# FingerprintVerificationDemoAndroid
This is a demo application showing fingerprint verification.
Run the app and you will be prompt with a password field and a login button. Put in any text as your password and press login. When login button is pressed, the application uses SharedPreferences to store the password for later logins.
Close the app, after logging in. Run the app again. Now, you will see a fingerprint ImageButton. When you click on the finger image button, you will be asked to put your finger in your fingerprint sensor.
If you have a fingerprint already registered on your phone, you will be logged into the MainActivity of the application.
